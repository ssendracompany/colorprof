Give me a commit title and description for this change that are tracked in English. For those that are not tracked in
git add, I want to ignore them. And I want you to rely on the use of emojis (gitmojis) as a guide for the commit title and description.

The project uses semantic versioning with GitMoji prefixes:

✨ :sparkles: - New features
🩹 :adhesive_bandage: - Bug fixes
♻️ :recycle: - Refactoring
🧪 :test_tube: - Tests
➕ :heavy_plus_sign: - Add TODOs
🔥 :fire: - Code cleanup or removal
🛻 :pickup_truck: - Move/rename files or directories
🔎 :mag: - Add loggers or observability
📝 :memo: - Documentation
🔧 :wrench: - Configuration

## RULES

- **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT add any Claude Code attribution, co-author tags, or "Generated with Claude Code" messages to commits
- NEVER mention Claude in commits
